Hello! 👋🏽

Welcome to the AI Developers & Entpreneurs Hub - a community based in the Greater New York area and the surrounding Tri-State region, and part of the larger [Global AI Community](https://globalai.community/) with over 35,000 members worldwide.

## About the Global AI Community

The [Global AI Community](https://globalai.community/about/) empowers developers who are passionate about AI to share knowledge through events and meetups. We host 3 global AI events across 100 locations that span every corner of the globe. We also provide a variety of resources to members of the community, including a free Meetup Pro account for user groups, event-in-a-box content, Azure passes, and support for booking Microsoft venues. We work closely with product teams at Microsoft to share workshop content about the newest Azure AI products.

## About This Meetup

The [AIDE-Hub](https://meetup.com/aide-hub) is a chapter of the Global AI Community based in the Greater New York region. This primarily covers the Tri-state region (New York, New Jersey, Connecticut) but also extends to communities in Pennsylvania and Massachussets that are in the same timezone and within reasonable commute distance for events.

We work closely with our Microsoft partners to take advantage of resources like venues and sponsorship when possible. However, we are techology and cloud agnostic and welcome speakers and talks on all topics related to AI, Apps and Automation. 


## Mission Statement

We want to help connect the community to relevant experts, resources - and each other - to build awareness of the fast-moving AI ecosystem, and translate that into actionable impact on careers, products and startups.

Let's learn, build and innovate together.


## Code Of Conduct

We want this to be a safe and inclusive community for everyone to participate in without fear of harassment, violence or discrimination. Please help us maintaining a professional and respectful attitude at all times. Harassment of members in any context (online or in-venue) will not be tolerated and may result in your being asked to leave the venue.
